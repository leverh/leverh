# Welcome to PixelSummit 🚀


I'm the person behind PixelSummit 🦹

## What I do ✨
* Listen
* Build websites that work
* Write code that solves problems
* Build things that make sense
* Keep it simple, functional, yet beautiful
* Skip the buzzwords

## My approach 💡
I believe in:
* Clear communication over endless meetings
* Working solutions over trendy tech
* Getting things done over talking about getting things done
* Honest timelines over unrealistic promises
* Pretty new technologies AND old-school practices

## Tech I use 💻
* React, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Next.js
* Three.js for fun 3D stuff
* Whatever else gets the job done efficiently

## Current projects 💥
* Building interactive 3D web experiences
* Exploring TypeScript
* Always learning, but without the "passionate" speeches about it

## Want to work together? 🏃‍♂️
* Check out my work at [PixelSummit.dev](https://pixelsummit.dev)
* No passion speeches, just solid development work

## Who am I? 👻
* I love cats 🐱
* Gamer 🎮
* I like to travel - especially to mountains 🏔️
* Peace and quiet is my favorite place to be 🌳
* Solving problems over writing motivational LinkedIn posts 💻

## Find me 🔍
* Probably coding
* Probably gaming
* Probably walking
* Most likely feeding some cats 🐱
* Definitely not writing about my "passionate journey in tech" 😉
